waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven. While waiting, they began 
to wonder: Could they possibly get married in Heaven? 

When St. Peter showed up, they asked him. St. Peter said, "I don't know. 
This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,'" and he left. 

The couple sat and waited, and waited. Two months passed and the couple were 
still waiting. While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it 
didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven? After yet another month, 
St. Peter finally returned, looking somewhat bedraggled. 

"Yes," he informed the couple, "You can get married in Heaven." 

"Great!" said the couple, "But we were just wondering, what if things don't 
work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?" 

St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 

"What's wrong?" asked the frightened couple. 

"OH, COME ON!," St. Peter shouted, "It took me three months to find a priest 
up here! Do you have any idea how long it'll take me to find a lawyer?"

A blonde hurries into the emergency room late one night with the tip 
of her index finger shot off.
"How did this happen?" the emergency room doctor asked her.
"Well, I was trying to commit suicide," the blonde replied.
"What?" sputtered the doctor. "You tried to commit suicide by shooting 
your finger off?"
"No silly!" the blonde said. "First I put the gun to my chest, and I 
thought: I just paid $6,000.00 for these breast implants, I'm not 
shooting myself in the chest."
"So then?" asked the doctor.
"Then I put the gun in my mouth, and I thought: I just paid $3000.00 
to get my teeth straightened, I'm not shooting myself in the mouth."
"So then?"
"Then I put the gun to my ear, and I thought: This is going to make 
a loud noise. So I put my finger in the other ear before I pulled 
the trigger."

An 80-year old Italian man goes to the doctor for a check-up.
The doctor is amazed at what good shape the guy is in and asks, "How 
do you stay in such great physical condition?"
"I'm Italian and I am a golfer," says the old guy," and that's why I'm 
in such good shape. I'm up well before daylight and out golfing up
and down the fairways. Have a glass of vino, and all is well."
"Well," says the doctor, "I'm sure that helps, but there's got to be 
more to it. How old was your Dad when he died?"
"Who said my Dad's dead?"
The doctor is amazed. "You mean you're 80 years old and your Dad's 
still alive. How old is he?"
"He's 100 years old," says the old Italian golfer. "In fact he golfed 
with me this morning, and then we went to the topless beach for a walk, 
that's why he's still alive. he's Italian and he's a golfer too."
"Well," the doctor says, "that's great, but I'm sure there's more to 
it than that. How about your Dad's Dad? How old was he when he died?"
"Who said my grandpa's dead?"
Stunned, the doctor asks, "You mean you're 80 years old and your 
grandfather's still living! Incredible, how old is he?"
"He's 118 years old," says the old Italian golfer. The doctor is getting 
frustrated at this point, "So, I guess he went golfing with you this 
morning too?"
"No. Grandpa couldn't go this morning because he's getting married today."
At this point the doctor is close to losing it. "Getting married! Why 
would a 118 year-old guy want to get married?"
"Who said he wanted to?"

A man was walking along a California beach and stumbled across an old 
lamp. He picked it up and rubbed it and out popped a genie. 
The genie said, "OK. You released me from the lamp, blah blah blah. 
This is the fourth time this month and I'm getting a little sick of 
these wishes so you can forget about three. You only get one wish!" 

The man sat and thought about it for a while and said, "I've always 
wanted to go to Hawaii but I'm scared to fly and I get very seasick. 
Could you build me a bridge to Hawaii so I can drive over there to 
visit?" 

The genie laughed and said, "That's impossible. Think of the logistics 
of that! How would the supports ever reach the bottom of the Pacific? 
Think of how much concrete... how much steel!! No, think of another 
wish." 

The man said OK and tried to think of a really good wish. 

Finally, he said, "I've been married and divorced four times. My wives 
always said that I don't care and that I'm insensitive. So, I wish that 
I could understand women....know how they feel inside and what they're 
thinking when they give me the silent treatment... know why they're 
crying, know what they really want when they say 'nothing'... know how 
to make them truly happy...." 

The genie asked, "Do you want that bridge two lanes or four?"

Obviously all of the heads of government and religious leaders 
want to speak to the aliens so they set up a meeting with our

"You mean J.C?", responds the alien. "yeah we know him he's the 
greatest isn't he? He swings by every year to make sure that we 
are doing ok". 

Surprised, the pope follows up with "He visits every year?! It's 
been over 2 millenia and we're still waiting for his SECOND coming!"

The alien sees that the pope has become irate at this fact and 
starts trying to rationalize "Maybe he likes our chocolate better 
than yours?"

does that have to do with anything?"

The alien says "Yea, when he FIRST visited our planet we gave him

A wealthy old lady decides to go on a photo safari in Africa, taking 
her poodle along for company.

One day the poodle starts chasing butterflies and before long, discovers 
that he's lost. 

Wandering about, he notices a hungry-looking leopard heading rapidly in 
his direction.

The poodle thinks, "Oh, oh!" 

Noticing some bones on the ground close by, he immediately settles down 
to chew on the bones with his back to the approaching cat. 

Just as the leopard is about to leap, the poodle exclaims loudly, "Boy, 
that was one delicious leopard! I wonder if there are any more around 
here?"

Hearing this, the leopard halts his attack in mid-strike, a look of 
terror comes over him and he slinks away into the trees. 

"Whew!", says the leopard, "That was close! That poodle nearly had me!"

Meanwhile, a monkey who had been watching the whole scene from a nearby 
tree, figures he can put this knowledge to good use and trade it for 
protection from the leopard. So off he goes, but the poodle sees him 
heading after the leopard with great speed, and figures that something 
must be up. 

The monkey soon catches up with the leopard, spills the beans and strikes 
a deal for himself with the leopard.

The leopard is furious at being made a fool of and says, "Here, monkey, 
hop on my back so you can watch me chew that poodle to bits!"

Now, the poodle sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his back and 
thinks, "What am I going to do now?", but instead of running, the dog 
sits down with his back to his attackers, pretending he hasn't seen them 
yet, and waits until they get just close enough to hear.

"Where's that damn monkey?" the poodle says, "I sent him off an hour ago 
to bring me another leopard!"

A magician worked on a cruise ship. 

The audience was different each week so the magician did the same tricks 
over and over again. 

There was only one problem: the captain's parrot saw the shows each week 
and began to understand how the magician did every trick. Once he 
understood, he started shouting in the middle of the show, "Look, it's 
not the same hat!" or, "Look, he's hiding the flowers under the table!" 
or "Hey, why are all the cards the ace of spades?" 

The magician was furious but couldn't do anything. It was, after all, the 
captain's parrot. 

Then one stormy night on the Pacific, the ship unfortunately sank, 
drowning almost all who were on board. 

The magician luckily found himself on a piece of wood floating in the 
middle of the sea, as fate would have it... with the parrot.

They stared at each other with hatred, but did not utter a word. 

This went on for a day... and then 2 days and then 3 days. 

Finally on the 4th day, the parrot could not hold back any longer and 
said... "OK, I give up. Where's the ship?"

Recently a routine police patrol was parked outside a bar in the Outback. 

After last call, the officer noticed a man leaving the bar so apparently 
intoxicated that he could barely walk. 

The man stumbled around the parking lot for a few minutes, with the 
officer quietly observing. 

After what seemed an eternity, in which he tried his keys on five different 
vehicles, the man managed to find his car and fall into it. 

He sat there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar 
and drove off. 

Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off; it was a fine, 
dry summer night, flicked the blinkers on and off a couple of times, honked 
the horn and then switched on the lights. 

He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little, and then 
remained still for a few more minutes as some more of the other patrons' 
vehicles left. 

At last, when his was the only car left in the parking lot, he pulled out 
and drove slowly down the road. 

The police officer, having waited patiently all this time, now started up 
his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, and promptly pulled the man 
over and administered a breathalyser test. 

To his amazement, the breathalyzer indicated no evidence that the man had 
consumed any alcohol at all! 

Dumbfounded, the officer said, "I'll have to ask you to accompany me to the 
police station. This breathalyser equipment must be broken."

During lunch at work, I ate 3 plates of beans (which I know I shouldn't). 
When I got home, my husband seemed excited to see me and exclaimed 
delightedly, "Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight." He then 
blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table. I took a 
seat and just as he was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. 
He made me promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned and went 
to answer the call. The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and 
the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my husband was out of the 
room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one 
go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running 
over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and 
fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I 
ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping 
my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on 
releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure 
was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end 
of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my 
napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very 
relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of 
innocence when my husband returned, apologizing for taking so long. He 
asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had 
not. At this point, he removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests 
seated around the table, with their hands to their noses, chorused, 
"Happy Birthday!"

A helicopter loses power over a remote Scottish island and makes an 
emergency landing. Luckily, there's a cottage nearby, so the pilot

My vats of hazardous chemicals will be covered when not in use. Also, 
I will not construct walkways above them.

If I'm eating dinner with the hero, put poison in his goblet, then have

You're a dumb criminal if ...

... You believe flattery will get you anywhere. Adan Juarez Ramirez had 
it all figured out-he could be a cop without having to take the boring 
test. But he was arrested in Grapevine, Texas, after pulling over a 
driver in his pickup truck, outfitted with flashing lights. He even 
had an ID badge, which he'd made by blacking out a restaurant gift card 
and etching in the word "POLICE." However, he'd kept the restaurant's 
logo, a jalape¤o pepper surrounded by the words "Chipotle Mexican Grill."

You're a dumb criminal if ...

... You leave IOUs. Graham Price of South Wales ripped off the bank 
where he worked, but he wasn't completely duplicitous. He left a 
note in the safe: 

"Borrowed, seven million pounds"-signed "Graham Price."

You're a dumb criminal if ...

... You vastly overrate your powers of persuasion. Marlon Moore of Miami 
filed a fraudulent tax return, and the IRS promptly sent him a $10,000 
refund. So figuring, Why not try my luck again?, he sent in three more 
tax returns. But even the IRS raised an eyebrow at cutting him a check 
for the total amount of the refunds: more than $14 trillion. Moore 
pleaded guilty to cashing the $10,000 check.

You're a dumb criminal if ...

... You think presidents need a promotion. James Rhyne of Memphis was 
charged with forgery after he handed a waitress a $100 bill. The 
waitress knew something was funny with the money: Instead of the portly 
visage of Ben Franklin, it was the star of the $5 bill, Abe Lincoln, 
who was staring back at her.

You're a dumb criminal if ...

... You leave a paper trail. Hickory, North Carolina, cops were able to 
solve in record time the mystery of the two cash registers purloined

discovered a trail of white register tape. They followed it 50 yards 
to an apartment, where, they say, Donny Guy was cracking the registers 
open.

You're a dumb criminal if ...

... You love too much. Maybe Stephfon Bennett should try online dating. 
After he and two accomplices allegedly mugged a couple in Columbus, 
Ohio, police say he found the woman's ID in her purse, then showed up 
at her door with a simple proposal: How about a date? Since a girl 
likes to play hard to get, she called the cops, who arrested Bennett 
outside her home.

You're a dumb criminal if ...

... You skimp on travel expenses. Twelve Middle Eastern immigrants 
forgot the first rule of sneaking into a country: Don't call 
attention to yourself. En route to England from Germany, they snuck 
a ride in the back of a man's truck. They stayed mum throughout 
their trip, even as they crossed the Channel into England. But once 
they hit Dover, they celebrated their arrival with songs and whoops. 
Not for long, though. The startled driver headed to a police station, 
where the 12 were apprehended.

You're a dumb criminal if ...

... You're convinced the laws of physics don't apply to you. Clive 
Halford thinks big! The British career criminal stole a truck and 
loaded it with 18 pallets of stolen nickel and copper worth around 
150,000 (about $250,000). Yes, the haul was huge-too huge. Cops 
arrested Halford after the truck's suspension collapsed under the 
weight. Earlier, Halford had stolen a car, overloaded it, and broken 
its suspension too.

You're a dumb criminal if ...

... You text and rob. Nicholas Greenly dropped his cell phone near where 
an 84-year-old woman had her purse snatched in Mount Lebanon,

You're a dumb criminal if ...

... You play both roles in a game of cops and robbers. Being a key 
suspect in a robbery wasn't going to stop Romeo Montillano from 
realizing his dream of becoming a Chula Vista, California, police 
officer. Unfortunately for Montillano, his would-be colleagues put 
the kibosh on his plans, arresting him when he showed up to take 
the entrance exam. As he was led away, Montillano had one question: 
Could he take the test later? His request was denied.

You're a dumb criminal if ...

... You take the holidays too seriously. Robert E. Dendy of upstate

Since the officers were well acquainted with Dendy, they did some 
snooping and arrested him for stealing the wreath from a store down 
the block.

You're a dumb criminal if ...

... You let your supply of antismoking patches run out. An Indiana state 
trooper stopped a car for a traffic violation. When a passenger, 
Honesty Knight, asked if she could smoke, the officer said yes. She 
proceeded, police say, to light up a joint.

You're a dumb criminal if ...

... You air your neighbor's dirty laundry. As she walked around her 
neighbor's yard sale in Severn, Maryland, the woman couldn't help 
admiring the items. The Oriental rug, the luggage, the shoes-they 
were exactly her style. And why not? They were hers, as was 
everything else on display. David Perticone says somebody sold him 
the stuff. But cops think Perticone did the deed himself.

You're a dumb criminal if ...

... You can't let go of your friends. Two New Zealand prisoners had the 
brilliant idea of fleeing the courthouse while tethered together by

You're a dumb criminal if ...

... You neglect to look up local hotels on your GPS. Mitchell Deslatte 
walked into a Baton Rouge, Louisiana, hotel and asked the clerk for a

hotel was actually a state trooper station. That's when Deslatte was

365.
You're a dumb criminal if ...

... You harbor grudges. Joseph Goetz's alleged attempt to rob a York, 
Pennsylvania, bank met with some snags. Cops say the first teller 
he tried to rob fainted and the next two insisted they had no cash 
in their drawers. Fed up, Goetz stormed out, threatening to write 
an angry letter to the bank.

366.
You're a dumb criminal if ...

... You leave a far too indelible impression. Victims of a home robbery

photos. Turns out, there aren't too many other people with a map of 
Florida tattooed on their face. Still, Roberts is pleading not guilty.

You're a dumb criminal if ...

... You depend on the kindness of strangers. Christopher Wilson of 
Spokane left his name and phone number with clerks at a home-
improvement store should anyone find something of his that he'd 
dropped, according to police. They did find something, and Wilson 
was arrested for possession of methamphetamines.

You're a dumb criminal if ...

T-shirt that said it all: "Miss Wasted."

He pulled her over and said, "Hey, lady, would you mind telling me 
why you're going so fast down the middle of the road?"

"Oh, it's okay, Officer," she replied. "I have a special license that 
allows me to drive like that."

"Oh, yeah?" Let's see it." The cop looked at the license and then 
concluded, "Ma'am, there's nothing special about this. It's just 
a temporary license."

"Yes, from a block away," the officer answered.

"Was the area well lit?"

"No. It was pretty dark."

"Then how could you identify the defendant?" I asked, concerned.

Looking at me as if I were nuts, he answered, "I'd recognize my cousin

I am a deputy sheriff assigned to courthouse security. As part of my job, I 
explain court procedures to visitors. One day I was showing a group of 
ninth-graders around. Court was in recess and only the clerk and a young man 
in custody wearing handcuffs were in the courtroom. "This is where the judge 
sits," I began, pointing to the bench. "The lawyers sit at these tables. The 
court clerk sits over there. The court recorder, or stenographer, sits over 
here. Near the judge is the witness stand and over there is where the jury 
sits. As you can see," I finished, "there are a lot of people involved in 
making this system work."

At that point, the prisoner raised his cuffed hands and said, "Yeah, but 
I'm the one who makes it all happen."

As a judge, I was sentencing criminal defendants when I saw a vaguely

"Milton," I asked, puzzled, "how is it you were able to stay out of trouble 
for those five years?"

"I was in prison," he answered. "You should know that-you were the one who 
sent me there."

"That's not possible," I said. "I wasn't even a judge then."

"No, you weren't the judge," the defendant countered, smiling mischievously. 
"You were my lawyer."

As a potential juror in an assault-and-battery case, I was sitting in a

attorney asked such questions as: Had I ever been mugged? Did I know the

The defense attorney took a different approach, however. "I see you are 
a teacher," he said. "What do you teach?"

"English and theater," I responded.

"Then I guess I better watch my grammar," the defense attorney quipped.

"No," I shot back. "You better watch your acting."

When the laughter in the courtroom died down, I was excused from the case.

I was once a legal secretary to a young law clerk who passed the bar exam

Vacationing in Hawaii, two priests decide to wear casual clothes so they 
won't be identified as clergy. They buy Hawaiian shirts and sandals, and 
soon hit the beach. They notice a gorgeous blonde in a tiny bikini. 
"Good afternoon, Fathers," she says as she strolls by.

The men are stunned. How does she know they're clergy? Later they buy 
even wilder attire: surfer shorts, tie-dyed T-shirts, and dark glasses. 
The next day, they return to the beach. The same fabulous blonde, now 
wearing a string bikini, passes by, nods politely at them, and says, 
"Good morning, Fathers."

"Just a minute, young lady," says one of the priests. "We are priests 
and proud of it, but how in the world did you know?"

bathroom was located. The bartender replied, "Second door to the right." 

The blind man headed for the bathroom, but accidentally tripped over and 
skipped the second door. Instead, he entered the third door, which lead to 
the swimming pool and fell into the pool by accident. 

Scared to death, the blind man started shouting, "Don't flush, don't flush!"

A blonde goes into work one morning crying her eyes out. Her boss, concerned
about his employee's well being, asks sympathetically, "What's the matter?"

The blonde replies, "Early this morning I got a phone call saying that my 
mother had passed away." 

"I'm terribly sorry to hear that. Why don't you go home for the day... we
aren't terribly busy. Just take the day off to relax and rest." 

The blonde very calmly explains, "No, I'd be better off here. I need to keep 
my mind off it and I have the best chance of doing that here." 

The boss agrees and allows the blonde to work as usual. "If you need 
anything, just let me know," he says. 

A few hours pass and the boss decides to check on the blonde. He looks out 
over his office and sees the blonde crying hysterically. He rushes out to 
her, and asks, "Are you going to be okay? Is there anything I can do to 
help?" 

"No," replies the blonde, "I just got a call from my sister, and she said
that HER mom died too!"

A young ventriloquist is touring the clubs and one night he's doing a show 
in a small club in a small town in Arkansas. With his dummy on his knee, 
he's going through his usual dumb blonde jokes when a blonde woman in the 
fourth row stands on her nchair and starts shouting: 

"I've heard enough of your stupid blonde jokes. What makes you think you 
can stereotype women that way? What does the color of a person's hair have 
to do with her worth as a human being? It's guys like you who keep women 
like me from being respected at work and in the community and from reaching 
our full potential as a person, because you and your kind continue to 
perpetuate discrimination against, not only blondes, but women in general...
and all in the name of humor!"

The ventriloquist is embarrassed and begins to apologize, when the blonde 
yells, "You stay out of this, mister! I'm talking to that little idiot on 
your knee!"

There was this man who was in a horrible accident, and was injured. But the
only permanent damage he suffered was the amputation of both of his ears. As
a result of this "unusual" handicap, he was very self-conscious about his 
having no ears. Because of the accident, he received a large sum of money
from the insurance company. It was always his dream to own his own business, 
so he decided with all this money he had, he now had the means to own a
business. So he went out and purchased a small, but expanding computer firm. 
But he realized that he had no business knowledge at all, so he decided that
he would have to hire someone to run the business. He picked out three top
candidates, and interviewed each of them. The first interview went really 
well. He really liked this guy. His last question for this first candidate
was, "Do you notice anything unusual about me?" 

The guy said, "Now that you mention it, you have no ears." 

The man got really upset and threw the guy out. 

The second interview went even better than the first. This candidate was 
much better than the first. Again, to conclude the interview, the man asked 
the same question again, "Do you notice anything unusual about me?" 

This guy also noticed, "Yes, you have no ears." 

The man was really upset again, and threw this second candidate out. 

Then he had the third interview. The third candidate was even better than
the second, the best out of all of them. Almost certain that he wanted to 
hire this guy, the man once again asked, "Do you notice anything unusual 
about me?" 

The guy replied "Yeah, you're wearing contact lenses." 

Surprised, the man then asked, "Wow! That's quite perceptive of you! How 
could you tell?" 

The guy burst out laughing and said, "Well, You can't wear glasses if you
don't have any ears!"

When Abraham Liebowitz gets to school he discovers that he is the only
Jewish kid in the class. But it's a decent town and nobody really bothers
him. 

One day the teacher asks the class "Who was the greatest person who ever
lived? and why?" And to make it interesting she held a twenty dollar bill
in the air and said "whoever gives the best answer will get this twenty
dollars". 

All of the kids called out their guesses. One said "George Washington - 
because he was the father of our country." 

"That's excellent" said the teacher. 

Another said "Abraham Lincoln - because he freed the slaves."

"That's also good" said the teacher, reluctant to bestow an excellent, 
but still being polite. 

One little girl said "Joan of Arc - because she saved France." 

Another excellent choice said the teacher. 

Then Abraham Liebowitz, raised his hand. So the teacher called on him. 
"Abraham, who do you think was the greatest person who ever lived, and 
why?" 

And Abraham said "Jesus Christ." 

The teacher was shocked. "Abraham," she said "I'm very surprised. Class, 
I think we can all agree that Abraham should get the twenty dollars." And
she handed Abraham Liebowitz the money. At recess, the teacher was still 
very impressed. So she asked Abraham why he said Jesus. 

Abraham said "Look, personally I think Moses was the greatest person who
ever lived, but... business is business!"

For all of you with teenagers or who have had teenagers, or are a teenager,
you may want to know why they really have a lot in common with cats: 

- Neither teenagers nor cats turn their heads when you call them by name.

- No matter what you do for them, it is not enough. Indeed, all humane 
efforts are barely adequate to compensate for the privilege of waiting on 
them hand and foot. 

- You rarely see a cat walking outside of the house with an adult human
being, and it can be safely said that no teenager in his or her right mind 
wants to be seen in public with his or her parents. 

- Even if you tell jokes as well as Jay Leno, neither your cat nor your 
teen will ever crack a smile. 

- No cat or teenager shares you taste in music. 

- Cats and teenagers can lie on the living-room sofa for hours on end 
without moving, barely breathing. 

- Cats have nine lives. Teenagers carry on as if they did.

- Cats and teenagers yawn in exactly the same manner, communicating that
ultimate human ecstasy -- a sense of complete and utter boredom. 

- Cats and teenagers do not improve anyone's furniture. 

- Cats that are free to roam outside sometimes have been known to return 
in the middle of the night to deposit a dead animal in your bedroom. 
Teenagers are not above that sort of behavior. 

Thus, if you must raise teenagers, the best sources of advice are not other
parents, but veterinarians. It is also a good idea to keep a guidebook on 
cats at hand at all times. And remember, above all else, put out the food 
and do not make any sudden moves in their direction. When they make up their
minds, they will finally come to you for some affection and comfort, and it 
will be a triumphant moment for all concerned.

A little boy walked down the aisle at a wedding. As he made his way to the
front, he would take two steps, then stop, and turn to the crowd, 
alternating between the bride's side and the groom's side. While facing the
crowd, he would put his hands up like claws and roar. 

And so it went-step, step, ROAR, step, step, ROAR-all the way down the aisle.
As you can imagine, the crowd was near tears from laughing so hard by the 
time he reached the pulpit. The little boy, however, was getting more and 
more distressed from all the laughing, and he was near tears by the time he
reached the pulpit. When asked what he was doing, the child sniffed back his

from the burning building by jumping into the net. He refused and loudly 
proclaimed, "I'm Fearless Jose the bullfighter who fears nothing, not even
fire."

The firemen begged and pleaded but to no avail. Jose kept prancing around
while repeating the same phrase over and over until the firemen got really
sick and tired of hearing it. Finally, when the flames began to scorch his
butt, Jose announced he had changed his mind, was ready to jump and then 
leaped off the rooftop. As his body hurtled toward the safety-net, the 
four firemen shouted, "Ole!" and quickly moved it aside.

A big-city lawyer was representing the railroad in a lawsuit filed by an

which the railroad passed. The rancher only wanted to be paid the fair 
value of the bull. 

The case was scheduled to be tried before the justice of the peace in the 
back room of the general store. The attorney for the railroad immediately
cornered the rancher and tried to get him to settle out of court. The 
lawyer did his best selling job, and finally the rancher agreed to take 
half of what he was asking. After the rancher had signed the release and 
took the check, the young lawyer couldn't resist gloating a little over 
his success, telling the rancher, "You know, I hate to tell you this, old

engineer was asleep and the fireman was in the caboose when the train went 
through your ranch that morning. I didn't have one witness to put on the

crowded & dirty and full of Italians. You're crazy to go to Rome. So, how 
are you getting there?"

"We're taking TWA," was the reply. "We got a great rate!"

"TWA?" exclaimed the barber. "That's a terrible airline. Their planes are old,
their flight attendants are ugly, and they're always late. So, where are you
staying in Rome?"

"We'll be at the downtown International Marriott."

"That dump! That's the worst hotel in the city. The rooms are small, the 
service is surly and they're overpriced. So, whatcha doing when you get 
there?" 

"We're going to go to see the Vatican and we hope to see the Pope."

"That's rich," laughed the barber. "You and a million other people trying to 
see him. He'll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of
yours. You're going to need it."

A month later, the man again came in for his regular haircut. The barber asked
him about his trip to Rome.

"It was wonderful," explained the man, "not only were we on time in none of 
TWA's brand new planes, but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to first 
class. The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a beautiful 28 year old 
stewardess who waited on me hand and foot. And the hotel-it was great! They'd
just finished a $25 million remodeling job and now it's the finest hotel in 
the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us the 
presidential suite at no extra charge!"

"Well," muttered the barber, "I know you didn't get to see the pope."

"Actually, we were quite lucky, for as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard 
tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the pope likes to personally meet 
some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room 
and wait the pope would personally greet me. Sure enough, five minutes later 
the pope walked through the door and shook my hand! I knelt down as he spoke 
a few words to me."

A car was involved in an accident in a street. As expected a large crowd
gathered. A newspaper reporter, anxious to get his story could not get
near the car. Being a clever sort, he started shouting loudly, "Let me
through! Let me through! I am the son of the victim."

The crowd made way for him. Lying in front of the car was a donkey.

A photographer for a national magazine was assigned to get photos of a
great forest fire. Smoke at the scene was too thick to get any good shots,
so he frantically called his home office to hire a plane. "It will be
waiting for you at the airport!" he was assured by his editor. As soon as
he got to the small, rural airport, sure enough, a plane was warming up
near the runway. He jumped in with his equipment and yelled, "Let's go!
Let's go!" 

The pilot swung the plane into the wind and soon they were in the air.
"Fly over the north side of the fire," said the photographer, "and make
three or four low level passes."

"Why?" asked the pilot.

"Because I'm going to take pictures! I'm a photographer, and photographers
take pictures!" said the photographer with great exasperation. 

After a long pause the pilot said, "You mean you're not the instructor?"

A married couple was in a terrible accident where the woman's face was
severely burned. The doctor told the husband that they couldn't graft the
skin from her body, so the husband offered to donate some of his own skin. 
However, the only skin on his body that the doctor found suitable would
have to come from his rear end. The husband and wife agreed that they 
would tell no one about where the skin came from, and requested that the
doctor also honor their secret. After all, this was a very delicate
matter. 

After the surgery was completed, everyone was astounded at the woman's 
new beauty. She looked more beautiful than she ever had before! All her 
friends and relatives just went on and on about her youthful beauty! One
day, she was alone with her husband, and she was overcome with emotion at
his sacrifice. 

She said, "Dear, I just want to thank you for everything you did for me.
There is no way I could ever repay you." 

"My darling," he replied," think nothing of it. I get all the thanks I
need every time I see your mother kiss you on the cheek."

A man and his wife were making their first doctor visit, the wife being
pregnant with their first child. After everything checked out, the doctor
took a small stamp and stamped the wife's stomach with indelible ink. The

the husband got out his magnifying glass to try to see what it was.

In very tiny letters, the stamp said, "When you can read this, come back

A man was driving along the highway, and saw a rabbit hopping across the
middle of the road. He swerved to avoid hitting the rabbit, but
unfortunately the rabbit jumped in front of the car and was hit. The
driver, being a sensitive man as well as an animal lover, pulled over to
the side of the road and got out to see what had become of the rabbit.
Much to his dismay, the rabbit was dead. The driver felt so awful he began
to cry.

A woman driving down the highway saw the man crying on the side of the
road and pulled over. She stepped out of her car and asked the man what
was wrong.

"I feel terrible," he explained. "I accidently hit this rabbit and killed
it." The woman told the man not to worry. She knew what to do. She went to
her car trunk and pulled out a spray can. She walked over to the limp,
dead rabbit, and sprayed the contents of the can onto the rabbit. 

Miraculously, the rabbit came to life, jumped up, waved its paw at the
two humans and hopped down the road. 50 feet away the rabbit stopped,
turned around, waved at the two again, hopped down the road another 50
feet, turned, waved, and hopped another 50 feet. 

The man was astonished. He couldn't figure out what substance could be in
the woman's spray can! He ran over to the woman and demanded, "What was in
your spray can? What did you spray onto that rabbit?" 

The woman turned the can around so that the man could read the label. It 
said:"Hare Spray Restores Life to Dead Hare. Adds Permanent Wave."

A fellow stopped at a rural gas station and, after filling his tank, he
paid the bill and bought a soft drink. He stood by his car to drink his
cola and he watched a couple of men working along the roadside. One man
would dig a hole two or three feet deep and then move on. The other man
came along behind and filled in the hole. While one was digging a new
hole, the other was about 25 feet behind filling in the old. The men
worked right past the fellow with the soft drink and went on down the
road. "I can't stand this," said the man tossing the can in a trash
container and heading down the road toward the men. "Hold it, hold it,"
he said to the men. "Can you tell me what's going on here with this
digging?" 

"Well, we work for the county government," one of the men said.

"But one of you is digging a hole and the other is filling it up. You're
not accomplishing anything. Aren't you wasting the county's money?"

"You don't understand, mister," one of the men said, leaning on his shovel
and wiping his brow. "Normally there's three of us--me, Rodney and Mike. I
dig the hole, Rodney sticks in the tree and Mike here puts the dirt back."

"Yea," piped up Mike. "Now just because Rodney's sick, that don't mean we
can't work, does it?"

Little Mary was not the best student in Sunday School. Usually she slept
through the class. One day the teacher called on her while she was
napping, "Tell me, Mary, who created the universe?" 

When Mary didn't stir, little Johnny, an altruistic boy seated in the
chair behind her, took a pin and jabbed her in the rear. "God Almighty!"
shouted Mary, and the teacher said, "Very good," and Mary fell back
asleep. 

A while later the teacher asked Mary, "Who is our Lord and Savior," but
Mary didn't even stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to the
rescue, and stuck her again. "Jesus Christ!" shouted Mary, and the teacher
said, "Very good," and Mary fell back asleep.

Then the teacher asked Mary a third question. "What did Eve say to Adam
after she had her twenty-third child?" And again, Johnny jabbed her with
the pin. This time Mary jumped up and shouted, "If you stick that damn
thing in me one more time, I'll break it in half!"

This guy goes to the zoo one day. While standing in front of the gorilla's
cage, a gust of wind swept some dust into his eye. As he rubbed his
eyelid, the gorilla went crazy, bent open the bars, and beat the guy 
senseless. 

When the guy came to his senses, he reported the incident to the
zookeeper. Nodding, the zookeeper explained that pulling down your eyelid 
means "F**k you!" in gorilla language. The explanation didn't make the
victim feel any better and he vowed revenge. 

The next day he purchased two large knives, two party hats, two party
horns, and a large sausage. Putting the sausage in his pants, he hurried 
to the zoo and over to the gorilla's cage, where he tossed a hat, a knife,
and a party horn. Knowing that gorillas were natural mimics, he put on a 
party hat. The gorilla looked at him, looked at the hat, and put it on.
Next, he picked up his horn and blew on it. The gorilla picked up his horn
and did the same. Then the man picked up his knife, whipped the sausage
out of his pants, and sliced it in half.

The gorilla looked at the knife, looked at his own crotch, looked at the
man, and pulled down his eyelid.

Well, the lady is furious! She stormed past the store to her work. On 
the way home she saw the same parrot and it said to her, "Hey lady, 
you are really ugly." She was incredibly ticked now. 

The next day the same parrot again said to her, "Hey lady, you are 
really ugly." The lady was so ticked that she went into the store and
said that she would sue the store and kill the bird. 

The store manager replied, "That's not good," and promised he wouldn't
say it again. When the lady walked past the store that day after work 
the parrot called to her, "Hey lady." 

She paused and said, "Yes?"

The bird said, "You know."

Dear Boss,
I hope I haven't misunderstood your instructions. Because to be 
honest, boss, none of this Y to K dates problem makes any sense to me.

At any rate I have finished converting all the months on all the 
company calendars so that the year 2000 is ready to go with the 
following improved months: Januark, Februark, Mak, Julk. In addition,
I have changed the days of the week, and they are now: Sundak, Mondak,
Tuesdak, Wednesdak, Thursdak, Fridak and Saturdak.

Is it enough, or should I change any other Y to K? I am a fan of the

A man is flying from Los Angeles to New York. During the meal service,
accidentally knocked the spoon off to the aisle with his elbow. The 
flight attendant immediately took a spoon from his pocket and placed 
it on his tray table. The man was very impressed by the promptness of
he service and asked, "Do all flight attendants carry a spoon in their
pockets?"

The flight attendant answered, "We had an efficiency expert in to 
evaluate our operation. He determined that 25% of the customers knock 
the spoon off their tray tables. By carrying a spare spoon, we all save
trips to the galley and can be much more efficient."

Later, as the flight attendant is picking his dirty tray up, the 
customer asked, "Excuse me for asking but why do you have a string 
hanging from your fly?"

The flight attendant replied, "The efficiency expert determined that 
we were spending too much time washing our hands after we went to the 
bathroom. To counteract this, we tie strings to our penises."

The customer looked confused. "How does that help?" he asked.

"Well, when I go to the bathroom I just use the string. Since I never 
touched myself I don't need to wash my hands."

The customer nodded and asked, "But how do you get it back in your 
pants?"

The flight attendant smiled, "I don't know about the other guys, but

Southwest Airlines makes humor a high priority. Here are some actual 
humorous statements by airline flight crews: 

"Good morning. As we leave Dallas, it`s warm, the sun is shining, and
the birds are singing. We are going to Charlotte, where it`s dark, 
windy and raining. Why in the world y`all wanna go there I can`t 
imagine." 

"As we prepare for takeoff, please make sure your tray tables and 
seat backs are fully upright in their most uncomfortable position."

"Your seat cushions can be used for floatation, and in the event of 
an emergency water landing, please take them with our compliments." 

"We do feature a smoking section on this flight; if you must smoke, 
contact a member of the flight crew and we will escort you to a seat 
outside on the wing of the airplane." 

"Smoking in the lavatories is prohibited. Any person caught smoking 
in the lavatories will be asked to leave the plane immediately." 

"There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only 4 ways 
out of this airplane..." 

"If you are so lucky to be traveling with small children..." 

Flight attendant: To operate your seatbelt, insert the metal tab into 
the buckle, and pull tight. It works just like every other seatbelt, 
and if you don`t know how to operate one, you probably shouldn`t be 
out in public unsupervised. 

In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will 
descend from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it 
over your face. If you have a small child traveling with you, secure 
your mask before assisting with theirs. If you are traveling with two 
small children, decide now which one you love more." 

"Should the cabin lose pressure, oxygen masks will drop from the 
overhead area. Please place the bag over your own mouth and nose 
before assisting children or adults acting like children." 

Pilot: "We are pleased to have some of the best flight attendants in 
the industry...Unfortunately none of them are on this flight...! 

Pilot: "Folks, we have reached our cruising altitude now, so I am 
going to switch the seat belt sign off. Feel free to move about as 
you wish, but please stay inside the plane till we land... it`s a bit
cold outside, and if you walk on the wings it affects the flight 
pattern." 

At the end of a flight: "Our flight attendants are now walking 
through the aisles with trash receptacles for any garbage you might 
have or anything else that you might wanna give us!" 

As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National, 
a lone voice comes over the loudspeaker: "Whoa, big fella...WHOA..!" 

"As you exit the plane, please make sure to gather all of your 
belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the
flight attendants. Please do not leave children or spouses." 

"Last one off the plane must clean it."

One day at a busy airport, the passengers on a commercial airliner 
are seated, waiting for the cockpit crew to show up so they can get 
underway. 

The pilot and copilot finally appear in the rear of the plane, and 
begin walking up to the cockpit through the center aisle. Both appear
to be blind. The pilot is using a white cane, bumping into passengers
right and left as he stumbles down the aisle, and the copilot is 
using a guide dog. Both have their eyes covered with huge sunglasses.

At first the passengers do not react; thinking that it must be some 
sort of practical joke. However, after a few minutes the engines 
start revving and the airplane starts moving down the runway. The 
passengers look at each other with some uneasiness, whispering among 
themselves and looking desperately to the stewardesses for 
reassurance. 

Then the airplane starts accelerating rapidly and people begin 
panicking. Some passengers are praying, and as the plane gets closer 
and closer to the end of the runway, the voices are becoming more and
more hysterical. Finally, when the airplane has less than 20 feet of 
runway left, there is a sudden change in the pitch of the shouts as 
everyone screams at once, and at the very last moment the airplane 
lifts off and is airborne.

Up in the cockpit, the copilot breathes a sigh of relief and turns to
the pilot: "You know, one of these days the passengers aren't going 
to scream, and we're gonna get killed!"

On the first day, God created the dog and said: "Sit all day by the 
door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in or walks past. For 
this, I will give you a life span of twenty years." The dog said: 
"That's a long time to be barking. How about only ten years and I'll 
give you back the other ten?" 

So God agreed. 

On the second day, God created the monkey and said: "Entertain people, 
do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I'll give you a twenty-year 
life span." The monkey said: "Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a 
pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the 
Dog did?" 

And God agreed. 

On the third day, God created the cow and said: "You must go into the 
field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have 
calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will 
give you a life span of sixty years." The cow said: "That's kind of a 
tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and 
I'll give back the other forty?" 

And God agreed again. 

On the fourth day, God created man and said: "Eat, sleep, play, marry 
and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years." But man 
said: "Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the 
forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten 
the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?" 

"Okay," said God, "You asked for it." 

So that is why the first twenty years we eat, sleep, play and enjoy 
ourselves. For the next forty years we slave in the sun to support our 
family. For the next ten years we do monkey tricks to entertain the 
grandchildren. And for the last ten years we sit on the front porch 
and bark at everyone. 

Life has now been explained to you.

blue bricks and a pink house is made from pink bricks and a black house is 
made from black bricks , what is a green house made from?

heck are you still reading these??? If you said "glass," go on to Question 4.

-4. It's twenty years ago, and a plane is flying at 20,000 feet over Germany 
(If you will recall, Germany at the time was politically divided into West 
Germany and East Germany .) Anyway, during the flight, two engines fail. The 
pilot, realizing that the last remaining engine is also failing, decides on a
crash landing procedure. Unfortunately the engine fails before he can do so 
and the plane fatally crashes smack in the middle of "no man's land" between 
East Germany and West Germany . Where would you bury the survivors? East 
Germany , West Germany , or no man's land"?

Answer: You don't bury survivors.

If you said ANYTHING else, you're a dunce and you must stop. If you said, 
"You don't bury survivors", proceed to the next question.

Divorce Whisperer

A judge was interviewing a woman regarding her pending divorce, and asked, 
"What are the grounds for your divorce?"

She replied, "About four acres and a nice little home in the middle of the 
property with a stream running by."

"No," he said, "I mean what is the foundation of this case?"

"It is made of concrete, brick and mortar," she responded.

"I mean," he continued, "What are your relations like?"

"I have an aunt and uncle living here in town, and so do my husband's 
parents."

He said, "Do you have a real grudge?"

"No," she replied, "We have a two-car carport and have never really needed 
one."

"Please," he tried again, "is there any infidelity in your marriage?"

"Yes, both my son and daughter have stereo sets. We don't necessarily like 
the music, but the answer to your questions is yes."

"Ma'am, does your husband ever beat you up?"

"Yes," she responded, "about twice a week he gets up earlier than I do."

Finally, in frustration, the judge asked, "Lady, why do you want a divorce?"

"Oh, I don't want a divorce," she replied. "I've never wanted a divorce. 
My husband does. He said he can't communicate with me."

A very large, old, building was being torn down in Chicago to make room for 
a new skyscraper. Due to its proximity to other buildings it could not be 
imploded and had to be dismantled floor by floor.

While working on the 49th floor, two construction workers found a skeleton 
in a small closet behind the elevator shaft. They decided that they should 
call the police. When the police arrived they directed them to the closet 
and showed them the skeleton fully clothed and standing upright. They said, 
"This could be Jimmy Hoffa or somebody really important."

Two days went by and the construction workers couldn't stand it any more, 
they had to know who they had found. They called the police and said, "We 
are the two guys who found the skeleton in the closet and we want to know if 
it was Jimmy Hoffa or somebody important."

The police said, "It's not Jimmy Hoffa, but it was somebody kind of 
important."

"Well, who was it?"

In a city park stood two statues, one female and the other male. These two 
statues faced each other for many years. Early one morning an angel appeared 
before the statues and said, "Since the two of you have been exemplary 
statues and have brought enjoyment to many people, I am giving you your 
greatest wish. I hereby give you the gift of life. You have 30 minutes to do 
whatever you desire." And with that command, the statues came to life.

The two statues smiled at each other, ran toward some nearby woods and dove 
behind a couple of bushes. The angel smiled to himself as he listened to the 
two statues giggling, bushes rustling and twigs snapping.

After 15 minutes, the two statues emerged from the bushes, satisfied and 
smiling. Puzzled, the angel looked at his watch and asked the statues, "You 
still have 15 minutes. Would you like to continue?"

The male statue looked at the female and asked, "Do you want to do it again?"

Smiling, the female statue said, "Sure. But this time YOU hold the pigeon 
down and I'LL poop on its head!"

Once upon a time there was a very large office building in a very large city.
This building had 40 levels: level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4, level 5, 
level 6, level 7, level 8, level 9, level 10, level 11, level 12, level 13, 
level 14, level 15, level 16, level 17, level 18, level 19, level 20, 
level 21, level 22, level 23, level 24, level 25, level 26, level 27, 
level 28, level 29, level 30, level 31, level 32, level 33, level 34, 
level 35, level 36, level 37, level 38, level 39, and level 40. 

One day the owner of the building decided to get a PA system installed on 
every level, in case there was ever a fire and everyone in the building 
needed to be contacted at once. The system was installed on every level: 
level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4, level 5, level 6, level 7, level 8, 
level 9, level 10, level 11, level 12, level 13, level 14, level 15, 
level 16, level 17, level 18, level 19, level 20, level 21, level 22, 
level 23, level 24, level 25, level 26, level 27, level 28, level 29, 
level 30, level 31, level 32, level 33, level 34, level 35, level 36, 
level 37, level 38, level 39, and level 40. 

One day, an employee named John was doing some paperwork on the 21st level 
when he saw the pager for the PA system in his boss's office. He could not 
resist. He picked up the pager, turned it on, cleared his throat, and told 
a joke. It was funniest joke anyone in the building had ever heard. They 
were rolling in the aisles, laughing their heads off. The accountants on 
level 3 were in tears. The engineers on level 34 were in hysterics. In fact, 
workers on every level -- level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4, level 5, 
level 6, level 7, level 8, level 9, level 10, level 11, level 12, level 13, 
level 14, level 15, level 16, level 17, level 18, level 19, level 20, 
level 21, level 22, level 23, level 24, level 25, level 26, level 27, 
level 28, level 29, level 30, level 31, level 32, level 33, level 34, 
level 35, level 36, level 37, level 38, level 39, and level 40 -- could not 
stop laughing. 

He walked out the door of his boss's office, feeling all proud of himself, 
when who should he run into but his boss. "John, come with me now!" John 
relunctantly followed his boss back into his office. His boss looked at him 
with fury in his eyes. "John," he said, "your joke was very disruptive to 
the workers in this building! Productivity was decreased on level 1, level 2,
level 3, level 4, level 5, level 6, level 7, level 8, level 9, level 10, 
level 11, level 12, level 13, level 14, level 15, level 16, level 17, 
level 18, level 19, level 20, level 21, level 22, level 23, level 24, 
level 25, level 26, level 27, level 28, level 29, level 30, level 31, 
level 32, level 33, level 34, level 35, level 36, level 37, level 38, 
level 39, and level 40! You're fired! Clean out your desk and get out!" But 
then his frown softened and he added, "Still, I have to admit, that joke was
funny on so many levels."

Three Kiwis and three Aussies are traveling by train to a conference. At 
the station, the three Aussies each buy tickets and watch as the three Kiwis 
buy only a single ticket.

"How are three people going to travel on only one ticket?" asks an Aussie.

"Watch and you'll see," answers a Kiwi.

They all board the train. The Aussies take their respective seats but all 
three Kiwis cram into a bathroom and close the door behind them.

Shortly after the train has departed, the conductor comes around collecting 
tickets. He knocks on the bathroom door and says,"Ticket, please." The door 
opens just a crack and a single arm emerges with a ticket in hand. The 
conductor takes it and moves on.

The Aussies see this and agree it was quite a clever idea. So after the 
conference, the Aussies decide to copy the Kiwis on the return trip and save 
some money (being clever with money,and all that). When they get to the 
station, they buy a single ticket for the return trip. To their astonishment,
the Kiwis don't buy a ticket at all.

"How are you going to travel without a ticket?" says one perplexed Aussie. 
Watch and you'll see," answers a kiwi.

When they board the train the three Aussies cram into a bathroom and the 
three Kiwis cram into another one nearby. The train departs. Shortly 
afterward, one of the Kiwis leaves his bathroom and walks over to the 
bathroom where the Aussies are hiding.

The 70-year-old man sat down in the orthopedic surgeon's office. "You know, 
Doc," he said, "I've made love in more exotic cars than anyone I know. Must 
be at least a thousand."

"And now, I suppose, you want me to treat you for the arthritis you got from
scrunching up in all those uncomfortable positions," the medic said.

"Hell, no," the old fellow replied. "I want to borrow your Lamborghini."

While walking along the sidewalk in front of his church, the minister heard
the intoning of a prayer that nearly made his collar wilt. Apparently, his 
five-year-old son and his playmates had found a dead robin.

Feeling that proper burial should be performed, they had secured a small box
and cotton batting, then dug a hole and made ready for the disposal of the 
deceased.

The minister's son was chosen to say the appropriate prayers and with 
sonorous dignity intoned his version of what he thought his father always 
said: "Glory be unto the Faaaather. .and unto the Sonnn . ...... and into 
the hole he gooooes."

Worries While Flying

Two statisticians were traveling in an airplane from LA to New York. About 
an hour into the flight, the pilot announced that they had lost an engine, 
but don't worry, there are three left.

However, instead of 5 hours it would take 7 hours to get to New York. A 
little later, he announced that a second engine failed, and they still had 
two left, but it would take 10 hours to get to New York.

Somewhat later, the pilot again came on the intercom and announced that a 
third engine had died. Never fear, he announced, because the plane could fly
on a single engine.

However, it would now take 18 hours to get to new York. At this point, one 
statistician turned to the other and said, "Gee, I hope we don't lose that 
last engine, or we'll be up here forever!"

An American tourist in London decides to skip his tour group and explore the
city on his own. He wanders around, seeing the sights, occasionally stopping
at a quaint pub to soak up the local culture, chat with the locals, and have
a pint of stout.

After a while, he finds himself in a very nice neighborhood with big, stately
residences...no pubs, no stores, no restaurants, and worst of all NO PUBLIC 
RESTROOMS.

He really, really has to go, after all those Guinnesses. He finds a narrow 
side street, with high walls surrounding the adjacent buildings and decides 
to use the wall to solve his problem.

As he is unzipping, he is tapped on the shoulder by a London police officer,
who says, "I say, sir, you simply cannot do that here, you know."

"I'm very sorry, officer," replies the American, "but I really, really have
to go, and I just can't find a public restroom."

"Ah, yes," said the policeman..."Just follow me". He leads the American to 
a back delivery alley to a gate, which he opens.

"In there," points the policeman. "Go ahead sir, anywhere you like."

The fellow enters and finds himself in the most beautiful garden he has 
ever seen. Manicured grass lawns, statuary, fountains, sculptured hedges, 
and huge beds of gorgeous flowers, all in perfect bloom.

Since he has the policeman's blessing, he relieves himself and feels much 
more comfortable. As he goes back through the gate, he says to the police 
officer, "That was really decent of you... is that what you call English 
hospitality?"

"No sir...", replied the police officer, "...that is what we call the French
Embassy."

I came across this exercise suggested for seniors, to build muscle strength 
in the arms and shoulders. It seems so easy, so I thought I'd pass it on. 
The article suggested doing it three days a week. Begin by standing on a 
comfortable surface, where you have plenty of room at each side.

With a 5-lb. potato sack in each hand, extend your arms straight out from 
your sides, and hold them there as long as you can. Try to reach a full 
minute, then relax. Each day, you'll find that you can hold this position 
for just a bit longer.

After a couple of weeks, move up to 10-lb. potato sacks. Then 50-lb. potato 
sacks, and then eventually try to get to where you can lift a 100-lb. potato
sack in each hand and hold your arms straight for more than a full minute.

Once you feel confident at that level, put a potato in each sack.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR MICROSOFT'S NEW TV DINNER PRODUCT: You must first remove 
the plastic cover. By doing so you agree to accept and honor Microsoft rights
to all TV dinners. You may not give anyone else a bite of your dinner (which 
would constitute an infringement of Microsoft's rights). You may, however, 
let others smell and look at your dinner and are encouraged to tell them how 
good it is.

If you have a PC microwave oven, insert the dinner into the oven. Set the 
oven using these keystrokes:

mstv.dinn.//08.5min@50%heat

Then enter:

ms//start.cook_dindin/yummy\|/yum~yum:-)gohot#cookme.

If you have a Macintosh microwave oven, insert the dinner and press start. 
The oven will set itself and cook the dinner.

If you have a Unix microwave oven, insert the dinner, enter the ingredients 
of the dinner found on the package label, the weight of the dinner, and the 
desired level of cooking and press start. The oven will calculate the time 
and heat and cook the dinner exactly to your specification.

Be forewarned that Microsoft dinners may crash, in which case your oven must
be restarted. This is a simple procedure. Remove the dinner from the oven 
and enter:

ms.nodamn.good/tryagain\again/again.crap

This process may have to be repeated. Try unplugging the microwave and then 
doing a cold reboot. If this doesn't work, contact your oven vendor. The 
oven itself is obviously on the blink.

Many users have reported that the dinner tray is far too big, larger than 
the dinner itself, having many useless compartments, most of which are empty.
These are for future menu items. If the tray is too large to fit in your 
oven, you will need to upgrade your equipment.

Dinners are only available from registered outlets, and only the chicken 
variety is currently produced. If you want another variety, call Microsoft 
Help and they will explain that you really don't want another variety. 
Microsoft Chicken is all you really need.

Microsoft has disclosed plans to discontinue all smaller versions of their 
chicken dinners. Future releases will only be in the larger family size. 
Excess chicken may be stored for future use, but must be saved only in 
Microsoft approved packaging.

Microsoft promises a dessert with every dinner after '98. However, that 
version has yet to be released. Users have permission to get thrilled in 
advance.

Microsoft dinners may be incompatible with other dinners in the freezer, 
causing your freezer to self-defrost. This is a feature, not a bug. Your 
freezer probably should have been defrosted anyway.

tied the wagon to her dog's collar and to the cat's testicles.

"Little partner," the fire fighter said, "I don't want to tell you how to 
run your rig, but if you were to tie that rope around the cat's collar, I 
think you could go faster."

Understanding the Signs

Over the years, my husband and I have usually managed to decode the cute but
confusing gender signs sometimes put on restaurants' restroom doors (Buoys 
and Gulls, Laddies and Lassies, etc.), but every so often we get stumped.

Recently my husband Dave wandered off in search of the men's room and found 
himself confronted by two marked doors. One was labeled "Bronco," and the 
other was designated "Cactus." Completely baffled, he stopped a restaurant 
employee passing by.

"Excuse me; I need to use the restroom," Dave said. Gesturing toward the 
doors, he asked, "Which one should I use?"

"Actually, we would prefer you to go there," the employee said, pointing to 
a door down the hall marked "Men."

"Bronco and Cactus are private dining rooms."

An out-of-towner drove his car into a ditch in a desolated area. Luckily, a 
local farmer came to help with his big strong horse named Buddy. He hitched 
Buddy up to the car and yelled, "Pull, Nellie, pull!" Buddy didn't move. Then
the farmer hollered, "Pull, Buster, pull!" Buddy didn't respond. Once more 
the farmer commanded, "Pull, Coco, pull!" Nothing. Then the farmer 
nonchalantly said, "Pull, Buddy, pull!" And the horse easily dragged the car
out of the ditch.

The motorist was most appreciative and very curious. He asked the farmer why
he called his horse by the wrong name three times.

"Well... Buddy is blind and if he thought he was the only one pulling, 
he wouldn't even try!"

The general was confined to the military hospital for treatment of a minor 
malady.

For almost a week he made a complete nuisance of himself, irritating both 
staff and the other patients, demanding attention and expecting his every 
order to be followed immediately. He was in a six-man ward rather than a 
private room, his meals were too cold or not served to suit his taste, the 
light needed to be adjusted to his demands, the nighttime activities 
interfered with his rest... and on, and on.

One afternoon an orderly entered the room. "Time to take your temperature, 
General."

After growling at the orderly, the general opened his mouth to accept the 
thermometer.

"Sorry, General, but for this test we need your temperature from the other 
end."

A whole new barrage of verbal abuse followed, but the orderly was insistent 
that a rectal temperature was what the test called for.

The general at last rolled over, bared his rear, and allowed the orderly to 
proceed. The orderly then told the general, "Stay exactly like that and 
don't move. I'll be back in five minutes to check up on you" and withdrew.

An hour later, the head nurse entered the room, saw the general with his 
bare rear in the air and gasped, "What's going on here?"

"Haven't you ever seen someone having their temperature taken?"
the general barked.

A plastic surgeon invented a radical new face lift procedure and was 
explaining it to a prospective patient. He told her, "I'll install a 
special screw in the top of your skull. Your hair will cover it so it will
be unnoticed. Whenever you need a little tuck, we'll just tighten the screw
a little,... and the wrinkles will disappear!"

The woman was enthused and told the doctor to, "GO FOR IT!" The surgery was 
a resounding success, and the woman went home happy.

A few months later, the woman returned in a great state of agitation. She 
pointed to her face and said, "Just look at these bags under my eyes! Where 
the hell did they come from?"

The surgeon looked at her closely and said, "Those aren't BAGS under your 
eyes. Those are your breasts. And if you keep messing around with that 
screw,... pretty soon you'll have a goatee!"
